# Why Octant?

Why build what looks like another Kubernetes dashboard when there are already so many out there? ...

- [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)
- [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/)
- [Infra](https://infra.app)
- [K9S](https://k9scli.io/)

The answer is because Octant is not a dashboard, Octant is a platform that ships with a dashboard view.

The Octant team is building a platform that allows one to create developer experineces
that have Kubernetes at the core. The goal of Octant is to help developers reduce the need to think
about Kubernetes and focus their energy on thinking about their workloads.

As the Octant team tried out the various different tools, each of them was missing one
thing, the ability to easily extend them to create custom developer experiences around resources
in the Kubernetes cluster. This ability to extend and override the default
behavior of Octant is what makes it so powerful. This allows people
with the tacit knowledge of complex resources to build smart, insightful, and actionable interfaces
around those resources.

Our goal is simple, create a platform and a community that is working to simplify Kubernetes for everyone.

We hope you enjoy our work!
